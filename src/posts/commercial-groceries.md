We've been living on Commercial Drive for more than 12 years, and almost every day — and often more than once a day — I've ventured out, accompanied by nerdy, to buy some groceries from the local stores. When we first came here I was taken aback by just how grimy these stores were: I don't think they have got any cleaner, but I have probably grown accustomed to the grime.

So this is a quick tour of the notable grocery stores along a short stretch of Commercial Drive.
