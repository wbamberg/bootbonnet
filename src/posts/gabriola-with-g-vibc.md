On 29-30 September 2024 G and I went bike camping on Gabriola Island with the adorable folk of the [Vancouver Island Bikepack Collective (VIBC)](https://www.vanislandbikepack.com/).

The week before I was at [TPAC](https://www.w3.org/2024/09/TPAC/) in Anaheim and didn't get back till the Saturday: we'd hoped to go straight out there on the Saturday and spend two nights there, but it was too much of a quick turnaround, so I slept in my bed on the Saturday night and we headed out the next day. I took the Surly for extra carrying capacity in 4 panniers. G took the [Loophole](https://www.instagram.com/loopholebags/) handlebar bag containing snacks and her backpack containing clothes. We also brought ramen, oatmeal, tortillas, peanut butter and Made Good cookies.

We missed the ferry we wanted to get cos of traffic on the highway, so we were even later than we'd planned. G got juice on the ferry and for some reason stuck "Made With Real Fruit" stickers on her face. Maybe because she's made with real fruit?

The ride from Departure Bay to the Gabriola ferry was short but fun, except the bit where they inexplicably make you ride on the busy highway for a few hundred metres, but we just took the sidewalk.

We met a person giving out brownies, bananas, and stickers to cyclists for some kind of ride your bike week thing. Thanks, person!

The ferry to Gabriola is lovely, and the road to the campground on the other side is st-e-e-e-p but very short. We didn't know which campsites were ours but found some friendly VIBC people (Jesse and Chelsea) who helped us find a spot.

There were some beautiful [lobster mushrooms](https://www.westcoastforager.com/wild-edible-mushrooms/lobster-mushroom-guide) at our campsite but I didn't dare eat them.

We went to the rocks by the ocean where you can lounge about like a seal (aka seal rocks), and got the ramen started. G's friend S was there with her parents, they weren't bike camping but just there with friends.

It was already getting dark after ramen was finished, so we went and hung out with the other VIBC people by the fire, and G got to meet [Bodhi the Adventure Cat](https://www.instagram.com/bodhi_theadventurecat/), who's a most impressive animal.

The night was cold and very dark but we survived. In the morning G invented a new breakfast made of Made Good cookies glued to tortillas with peanut butter.

After that it was time to go, so I packed up while G rode laps of the campground. We met Alex at the ferry, and rode back with her, stopping for lunch on the way. We should have brought ferry entertainments for G but at least she got more face-stickers.

It would have been good to have more time on the island, but it was a great first bike camp for G. Thanks VIBC, you are awesome.
