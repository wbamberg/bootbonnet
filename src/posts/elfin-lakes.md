Over 11-12 August, Greta and I camped at Elfin Lakes, in Garibaldi Park. It was the first time either of us have hiked into a campsite, and the first time she's hiked to Elfin Lakes.

It's been almost exactly twenty years since the first time I did this hike. It was the first real hike I did after moving here, and I've hiked it at least ten times since, with a whole lot of different people. So hiking the trail this time, it felt like I was hiking through all the layers of time since I've been here, with the different people I've hiked the mountains with, and it was lovely to be able to add a new layer with Greta.

Here's me and Bill at the lakes in October 2004:

We miss you, Bill ❤️.

I don't think there are any hikes here that are so accessible but so beautiful. Admittedly, we have the slog up through the forest, past the piles of bear poo. But we know things will get better once we reach the old Red Heather campground and its magnificent toilet, as modelled by Andrea in July 2008 and Greta, 16 years later:

And here's what it looked like in May 2011:

Then as we get out of the trees the Tantalus mountains sneak up behind us, and we have the long airy walk along the ridge with Atwell Peak keeping us company and the whole sweep across past Opal Cone.

Then round the corner and the Mamquam massif floats into view like some deranged fondant cruise ship.

And we hike down Paul Ridge.

And over a bump, and there are the lakes at our feet, just like always.

Only this time it is different, because we don't have to go back. We put the tent up, go for a swim, eat ramen in the hut, and watch the mountains melt into the night.

In the morning, we wake up in a cloud and saddle up to hike back down.

On the way, Greta keeps me entertained with stories about the [Warrior cats](https://warriors.fandom.com/wiki/Warriors_Wiki), with special attention paid to Brightheart. The slog back through the trees seems to take forever, like it always does, but we make it back in the end.

Good job, Greta! I'm grateful to all the people who've hiked the trails with me in the past, and happy to be have shared this one with you.
