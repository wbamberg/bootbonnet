Two weeks ago I rode the Burnabop route, published on the great [Love Machine Cycling](https://www.lovemachinecycling.ca/) site. We tried to ride it a few weeks ago but got so lost we ran out of time to finish, so I wanted to come back for it.

It is an amazingly intricate route with lots of lovely trails, and felt like just a perfect sunny spring day for it.
