This is Nerdy:

I was given it at the [OOPSLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OOPSLA) conference, which took place in Vancouver in 2004, so long ago that OOP still seemed like the future, or at least the present.

Since then I've used it most days, schlepping vegetables up and down Commercial Drive, probably more than 5000 times in total. It's so amazingly robust that it was only a couple of years ago, when the handles disintegrated, that I was forced to use some other, inferior, tote bags for a while. But then grandma fixed them up with some remnants of old jeans, and it should be good for another 20 years.
